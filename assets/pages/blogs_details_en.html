                    If you're struggling with writing because your characters feel unclear, distant, or simply because
                    you haven't explored their depths as you should, this exercise is designed to help you bridge the
                    distance between you and your characters. It will support your writing process and help you overcome
                    writer's block.
                    <br><br>
                    The aim of this exercise is to help you build a fully developed character by exploring their
                    appearance, inner thoughts, and how they interact with the world.
